  #position: Software Analyst and Developer 
  description: >
    I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at 
    UFRN (Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte). I have experience working in software
    development and always enjoyed participating events such as local workshops and 
    programming marathons (ICPC, Codeforces). At the end of college I became interested 
    in EDA (Eletronic Design Automation) topics and my final graduation project was
    about HLS process. I intend to complete the master's degree and enter a PhD program later.

    My research interests include topics related to Reconfigurable Architectures, 
    HLS, Approximate Computing and Compilers. I'm currently working 
    on approximate computing techniques applied to code transformations and 
    reconfigurable architectures such as CGRA.
